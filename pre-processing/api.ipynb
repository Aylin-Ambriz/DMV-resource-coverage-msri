    "- **Operations**:\n",
    "  - `list.append(item)`: Add item to end\n",
    "  - `list[0]`: Get first item (0-indexed)\n",
    "  - `list[:5]`: Get first 5 items (slicing)\n",
    "  - `len(list)`: Get number of items\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dictionaries\n",
    "- **What it is**: A collection of key-value pairs, like a function mapping\n",
    "- **Math analogy**: Similar to a function f: domain → codomain\n",
    "- **Example**: `{'name': 'John', 'age': 25, 'city': 'San Francisco'}`\n",
    "- **Operations**:\n",
    "  - `dict['key']`: Get value for key\n",
    "  - `dict.get('key')`: Safely get value (returns None if key doesn't exist)\n",
    "\n",
    "## API (Application Programming Interface)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an API?\n",
    "- **Definition**: A way for programs to communicate with each other\n",
    "- **Analogy**: Like a restaurant menu - you request something specific, and the kitchen (server) prepares it\n",
    "- **Google Routes API**: We send location coordinates, Google returns driving directions\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTTP Requests\n",
    "- **GET**: \"Please give me information\" (like asking for a webpage)\n",
    "- **POST**: \"Here's some data, please process it\" (like submitting a form)\n",
    "- **Status Codes**:\n",
    "  - 200: Success (\"OK\")\n",
    "  - 400: Bad request (\"You asked for something wrong\")\n",
    "  - 401: Unauthorized (\"You don't have permission\")\n",
    "  - 500: Server error (\"Something went wrong on Google's side\")\n",
    "\n",
    "## JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is JSON?\n",
    "- **Purpose**: A standard way to structure data for communication between programs\n",
    "- **Format**: Similar to Python dictionaries, but stricter formatting rules\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n",
    "  \"coordinates\": {\n",
    "    \"latitude\": 37.7749,\n",
    "    \"longitude\": -122.4194\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  \"scores\": [85, 92, 78]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Concepts Used\n",
    "\n",
    "### Permutations\n",
    "- **Definition**: Arrangements where order matters\n",
    "- **Formula**: P(n,r) = n!/(n-r)!\n",
    "- **In our code**: `itertools.permutations(offices, 2)` creates all ordered pairs\n",
    "- **Example**: With offices A, B, C, we get: (A→B), (A→C), (B→A), (B→C), (C→A), (C→B)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combinations (not used here, but related)\n",
    "- **Definition**: Selections where order doesn't matter\n",
    "- **Formula**: C(n,r) = n!/(r!(n-r)!)\n",
    "- **If we used this**: We'd get half as many routes (A↔B same as B↔A)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Error Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why it's important\n",
    "- **Networks can fail**: Internet connection issues\n",
    "- **APIs can be down**: Google's servers might be temporarily unavailable\n",
    "- **Data can be malformed**: Unexpected response formats\n",
    "\n",
    "### How we handle it\n",
    "- **Check status codes**: `if response.status_code == 200:`\n",
    "- **Validate data exists**: `if \"routes\" in response_data:`\n",
    "- **Safe value extraction**: `distance = first_route.get(\"distanceMeters\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "## File Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing to files\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Save results for later use or analysis\n",
    "- **JSON format**: Human-readable and parseable by other programs\n",
    "- **The `with` statement**: Automatically closes files when done (prevents data corruption)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cost Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "### API Rate Limits\n",
    "- **Google's limits**: Number of requests per minute/day\n",
    "- **Our approach**: Process requests sequentially to avoid overwhelming the API\n",
    "\n",
    "### Financial Cost\n",
    "- **Current test**: 6 requests ≈ $0.03\n",
    "- **Full analysis**: 27,722 requests ≈ $138.61\n",
    "- **Optimization strategies**: \n",
    "  - Use combinations instead of permutations (halve the cost)\n",
    "  - Filter by distance (only calculate routes under certain distance)\n",
    "  - Use caching (save results to avoid re-calculating)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps for Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the route data, you can:\n",
    "1. **Calculate statistics**: Average distance, shortest/longest routes\n",
    "2. **Create visualizations**: Plot routes on maps, create histograms\n",
    "3. **Optimization problems**: Find optimal office locations, minimize total travel time\n",
    "4. **Network analysis**: Treat offices as nodes in a graph, analyze connectivity\n"
